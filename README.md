# Angular Single-Page Application (SPA) with Auth0

1. Create simple single page [Angular](https://angular.io/) web app with unprotected and protected pages
2. Using [Auth0](https://auth0.com), an Identity-as-a-Service (IDaaS) platform, create a Auth0 Application to serve as the IDaaS for the Angular SPA
3. Integrate web app with Auth0 client to protect pages behind authentication using [OAuth2](https://oauth.net/2/)

This tutorial uses the [Auth0 Angular SDK](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-angular) to secure Angular application

#### Caveats

1. No tests, static analysis or code quality checking
2. The world doesn't stop, so versions, dependencies, and documentation working as of Oct 2020...After that good luck! [Open an issue if you want.](https://github.com/dominicfarr/angular-auth0/issues)
