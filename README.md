# Angular Single-Page Application (SPA) with Auth0

A simple tutorial to create a SPA [Angular](https://angular.io/) web app and secure parts of the application by implementing user authentication. 

Authentication and authorization will be handled by an Identity-as-a-Service (IDaaS) platform, in this case, [Auth0](https://auth0.com) 

This tutorial uses the following:

1. [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/) to create angular app, components, services, etc
2. [Auth0 Angular SDK](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-angular) to secure the web application

#### Caveats

1. No tests, static analysis, code quality checking, no css, no fluff.
2. Rabbit holes of futher reading are clearly marked with this symbol :rabbit:
2. The world doesn't stop, so versions, dependencies, and documentation working as of Oct 2020...After that good luck! [Open an issue if you want.](https://github.com/dominicfarr/angular-auth0/issues)
