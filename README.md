# Angular Single-Page Application (SPA) with Auth0

A simple tutorial to create a SPA [Angular](https://angular.io/) web app and secure parts of the application by implementing user authentication. 

Authentication and authorization will be handled by an Identity-as-a-Service (IDaaS) platform, in this case, [Auth0](https://auth0.com) 

This tutorial uses the following:

1. [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/) to create angular app, components, services, etc
2. [Auth0 Angular SDK](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-angular) to secure the web application

#### Caveats

**Basically this tutorial is for me, to cement knowledge. In the unlikely evernt anyone else is reading this, [ymmv](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/ymmv) ** 

1. The reader of this tutorial is on mac, installed npm, yarn, anglular cli, node, etc.
2. No tests, static analysis, code quality checking, no css, no fluff.
3. Rabbit holes of futher reading are clearly marked with this symbol :rabbit:
4. The world doesn't stop, so versions, dependencies, and documentation working as of Oct 2020...After that good luck! Open an [issue](https://github.com/dominicfarr/tutorial-blog-angular-auth0/issues) if you really really want.
