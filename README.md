# Simple project to connect an Angular app with Auth0

1. Create simple single page [Angular](https://angular.io/) web app with unprotected and protected pages
2. Create an [Auth0](https://auth0.com) client for app
3. Integrate web app with Auth0 client to protect pages behind authentication using [OAuth2](https://oauth.net/2/)

#### Caveats

1. No tests,static analysis or code quality checking
2. The world doesn't stop, so versions, dependencies, and documentation working as of Oct 2020...After that good luck! [Open an issue if you want.](https://github.com/dominicfarr/angular-auth0/issues)
